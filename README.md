# qecML: Machine Learning Quantum Error Correction Toric Decoder

The source code in decoder.py takes a look at a decoder for the topological surface code. I used the TensorFlow library to implement this decoder. Utilizing machine learning, this decoder of the toric code has unprecedented efficiency and accuracy for the detection of quantum information lost through quantum decoherence. This decoder could pave the way forward to allow for fault-tolerance within quantum systems.
