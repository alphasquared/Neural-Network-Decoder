# Readme for circuit_model.py

The code in circuit_model.py implements a simplified Pauli error channel model for odd distance, square shaped surface code with rough edges [1]. The error model follows the circuit model described in [2] with some deviations which are discussed in [3].
In particular it does not include correlated two-qubit errors during the CNOT gates.
To avoid hook errors it uses the improvements suggested in [4].
The code layout and circuit are for example illustrated in figure 1 of [3].


## How to use the code to generate the data used in Figure 3 of Ref. [3]
1) In circuit_model.py, set the path (db_path) where the databases with the
   results shall be written to.  
   WARNING: existing databases will be overwritten!
2) Set the variable mode in circuit_model.py to  
   0 if you want the training data, or  
   1 if you want the validation data, or  
   2 if you want the test data.
3) python circuit_model.py


## How to use the code to generate the data used in Figure 4 of Ref. [3]
1) In circuit_model.py, set the path (db_path) where the databases with the
   results shall be written to.   
   WARNING: existing databases will be overwritten!
2) Set the variable fy in circuit_model.py to 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0
   corresponding to the different y-error rates from left to right in Figure 4
   of Ref. [3].  
3) Set the variable mode in circuit_model.py to  
   0 if you want the training data, or  
   1 if you want the validation data, or  
   2 if you want the test data.
4) python circuit_model.py
